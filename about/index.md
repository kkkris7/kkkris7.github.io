# Me

My name is Junjie (Chris) Li, and I'm currently enrolled at University of Maryland, college park as a data scientist graduate. I will be graduated by December, 2019 and 
eager to use my knowledge to change and improve our real world. 

With more understanding of data science, I found the whole data world come to be more and more elegant. The final goal of my career is to be a full stack python engineer. I want to dedicate myself to **Big Data, Machine Learning, Deep Learning, AI and Web Development.** 

Here is my two version of [CV1](https://kkkris7.github.io/about/Chris_Li_data_scientist.pdf) and [CV2](https://kkkris7.github.io/about/Junjie_(Chris)_Li_Resume_0901.pdf) (last update: 2019-09-14).

# This Site

This blog is dedicated to tracking my progress with personal projects. I also benefited a lot from many insightful blogs and now I have something to give back. Watching my notes published on websites also gives me motivation and a strange consolation. 

I also realized that this website can be used as a billboard of my professional backgrounds. This is a great proof for what I have learned.
